<h2>It's Halloween.....</h2>

<div class=wrapper>

<p>It's Halloween night, and you are on your way to a Halloween party. To get there, you have to go through the spooky woods, where the trolls live. It's dark, and foggy, but you enter the woods anyway....</p>

<p>Before long, you hear a strange grumbling noise. A troll appears out of the fog, and shouts at you: 'Where do you think you're going?' You tell him you just want to get to a party on the other side of the woods. The troll says he's been trick or treating already, but one of the other trolls has stolen his candy. He will only let you pass if you find at least 5 of his candies in the woods, and return them to him. You decide it's worth a try...
